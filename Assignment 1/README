SearchString
============
This code helps to count the number of ocuurances of a given String in the given input text file.
We are reading the input file into buffer of fixed size. Hence we can even run this code for larger input file, without worrying about in memory storage.

Implementation Logic
====================
The code traverses through the input string in a serial fashion and searches for the given string.
Every time a match is found the count is incremented. In the end count is returned.
fseek() and ftell() commands are used to shift the pointer to the end of file and determine the size fo the file.

Instructions to run the SearchString.c 
======================================
1. Run 'make' in the terminal.
	//All the objct filees will be created.
2. Run the command to search a given string from the input in the following format.
	count <input-filename> <search-string> <output-filename> 
	// Besides giving some output, an outfile is also created.
